# scFlowKit

**scFlowKit** is a modular single-cell RNA-seq analysis pipeline in R, with optional Python support.  
This project is built progressively as a personal toolkit for learning, prototyping, and reusing scRNA-seq analysis components.

## Features

- 🧬 Step-by-step modular analysis
- 📦 Clean and lightweight project structure
- 🔁 Reusable functions and custom visualizations
- ✍️ Well-commented code and learning notes

## Status

> Currently under development (started March 2025).  
> Focused on data loading and quality control modules.

## Goal

To build a clean and extensible single-cell RNA-seq analysis pipeline while deepening my understanding of scRNA-seq data processing, annotation, and visualization.
